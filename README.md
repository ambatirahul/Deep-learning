Me Bean is Surprised.

My Neural Network prediction ?

Huzzah !!! :sparkles:Surprise:sparkles: it predicted as surprise.

How about other facial expressions? Before that we need to dive in to understand how it predicted and how it is built.

As title says, I will be using deep learning to build models to predict facial expressions.

[Keras](https://keras.io/) will be used to build Neural Networks.
