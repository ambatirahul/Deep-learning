# Deep learning Capstone project proposal.

## Facial Expression Recognition.
### Problem
To predict facial expression of a person.

### Who is it for
It can be used by any application if it wants to know the users facial expression.
Possible application could be to get users facial expression before and after watching a movie clip or an event.

### Data
The data set is accquired from kaggle competition [Facial Expression Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge).

### Modeling approach
We want to predict a person's facial expression, supervised image classification techniques will be used to predict facial expression. <br>
Aim is to build various Neural Networks, train them and pick the model which performs the best to recognize facial expressions.

For image recognition will be using Convolutional Neural Networks with deep neural networks.

### Deliverables.
1. Code (Jupyter notebook), includes:
    1. Data Retrieval, Cleaning
    3. Exploratory Data Analysis
    4. Neural Networks Architecture
2. Report on the capstone project
3. Findings and presentaions on the project
